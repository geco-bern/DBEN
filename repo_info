This repository is sync with lauramarques/DBEN - branch master
BiomeE model is run from lauramarques/rsofun_lm - branch DBEN

Outputs:
See protocol in docs folder.

Issues:
- Check stand structure. Plots in ppt done taking last year of the simul (450) instead of the average.
- Revise outputs for 8 pfts in all sites. Wbgrowth outputs empty for BCI
- Grasses seem to have slipped into some woody variables (e.g.Wbgrowth, BA, BAgrowth). Grasses are not included in the woody biomass. Specifically, for the PFT specific variables include all PFTs, though for some of them grasses are not required.
- Check what causes "carbon imbalance" woody growth_rate - mort_rate = 0 ( in equilibrium) for BiomeEP (see section "Is the budget closed")
- Height never goes to 0 becuase all plants start from seedlings not seeds.
- Stemmort looks a bit low. The units are nstems per yr per m2. The unit of "Stemmort" is n_stems per year per m2 (how many trees died in a year in one square meter of land. So it is very small.
- gpp has only 0 values for BCI, revise!

What we meant to get is:
 * one P0 simulation per site which is plot-level regrowth simulations, which can therefore be compared against plot-level observations.
 * six PS simulations per site which are landscape-level (regrowth) simulations, where PS1 has the same parameter settings as the P0 simulations.(2x, one with 412ppm and one with 562ppm co2 forcing)
 Averaging through time. You can average through time to get to landscape level. Averaging over time (e.g. 400 years) is the same as averaging over space (400 plots). See math proof in Weng et al. 2012. https://doi.org/10.1029/2012JG002040
